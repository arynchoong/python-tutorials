# Python Tutorial 
This tutorial is structured so that it is easy to use, and easy to learn, and hopefully fun as well. 

## Structure
The different numbered folders are organised in a manner to mimic the progression of learning Python. Usually the earlier levels tend to pre-requisite knowlege for more in depth levels later, but can be used in whichever manner that is suitable.

### Directory structure:
 +-- notebook <- Jupyter notebooks  
 +--|-- 1_basic <- Python 101 & 102 etc.
 +--|-- 2_standard_libraries <- standard Python libraries  
 +--|-- 3_core_packages <- Indepth introduction to Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib   
 +--src <- Python Scripts  
 +--|-- package <- a module example
