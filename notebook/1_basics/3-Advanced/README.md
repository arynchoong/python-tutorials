 * Do not mix tabs and spaces. Tabs create confusion and it is recommended to use only spaces.
 * Maximum line length : 79 characters which help users with a small display.
 * Use blank lines to separate top-level function and class definitions and single blank line to separate methods definitions inside a class and larger blocks of code inside functions.
