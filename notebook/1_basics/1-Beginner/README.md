# Python 3.0

Python is the easiet language to learn, mainly because of its tenet to be a readible language.

It is also a cross platform language, meaning the same code can be run on the different OS platforms, whether it is Windows, OSX or Linux.

## Syntax
Syntax of a programming language is the set of rules that the compiler or intepreter (machine) translated use to translate human writen codes into machine language codes.

For Python 3.0 :-
 * Each line of python is taken as a logical command line terminated by the end of line (newline token)
 * The **Indentation** of the line is used to indicate logical blocks of code to be grouped together
 * Python ignores lines containing only spaces, tabs, formfeeds or comments, and is treated as a blank line.
 * Commenting in Python is done by using the hash character (#). All characters after the '#' character to the end of the line is ignored by the Python interpreter.
